Stock This Product
===============
A "Where to Buy" page that allows customers to find stores where a particular product is sold via the Google Maps API. The stores are uploaded via an Admin dashboard accessible only by site admin. Site admin can also upload a list of stores they are trying to sell into. If a customer searches an area that does not contain any stores the products are currently sold in, the map instead shows the prospective stores in the area and prompts the customer to reach out to the store owner via an in-app email client. Site admin can also view analytics relating to customer searches and messages sent.
